# EventSourcing

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

To set up eventstore db:
```
mix event_store.create                               
mix event_store.init
```
Right now it's actually better to run it via `iex -S phx.server` and use commands from `doc/`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
